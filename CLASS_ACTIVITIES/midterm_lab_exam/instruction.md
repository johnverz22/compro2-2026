## **Midterm Lab Assessment: Rock-paper-scissor Game with Networking**

### **I. Objective**
To design a networked system that handles multi-round game logic, custom object modeling, and data persistence using the specific implementation patterns discussed in class.

### **II. Game Specifications**
You are to develop a **Server** and a **Client** application for a competitive Rock-Paper-Scissors match between two remote players.

1.  **Input Mapping:** 
    * `0` = Rock
    * `1` = Paper
    * `2` = Scissors
2.  **Match Structure:** * The game consists of **10 rounds**.
    * The system must track the score of each player across these rounds.
    * At the end of the 10th round, the system must declare an overall match winner based on who won the most rounds.
    * Display the leaderboard at the end of the game
3.  **Data Modeling (Required):** * You **must** use Java classes to represent your data. This includes a `Player` class and any other necessary models (e.g., `GameResult` or `Match`) to organize information before it is processed or saved.
4.  **Persistence:** * The final match results (Player names/IDs and total wins) must be recorded.
5. **Logic Location:** All game rules, winner determination, and score tracking must be handled by the **Server**.

### **IV. Submission**
Push your codes in your repository under `midterm_lab` directory.
