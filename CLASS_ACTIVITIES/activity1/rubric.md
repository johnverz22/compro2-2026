### Part 1: Managing a Single Row (1D Array) - 8 Points

| Criteria                                                  | Points |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | :----: |
| **1. Array Declaration**                                  |   2    |
| - Correctly declares and initializes a 1D integer array `theaterRow` of size 8. |        |
| **2. Booking a Seat**                                     |   1    |
| - Correctly assigns `1` to the seat at index `3`.        |        |
| **3. Printing Seat Status**                               |   2    |
| - Implements a loop that iterates through the entire array. |        |
| - Prints the status of each seat.                         |        |
| **4. Counting Available Seats**                           |   3    |
| - Correctly initializes a counter.                        |        |
| - Loops through the array and increments the counter for available seats (`0`). |        |
| - Prints the final correct count of available seats.      |        |

### Part 3: Managing the Whole Theater (2D Array) - 12 Points

| Criteria                                                  | Points |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | :----: |
| **1. Array Declaration**                                  |   2    |
| - Correctly declares and initializes a 2D integer array `theater` with 5 rows and 8 columns. |        |
| **2. Booking Seats**                                      |   2    |
| - Correctly books the seat at `row 2, column 5`.          |        |
| - Correctly books the seat at `row 0, column 0`.          |        |
| **3. Printing the Seating Chart**                         |   4    |
| - Implements a correct outer loop for rows.               |        |
| - Implements a correct inner loop for columns.            |        |
| - Prints the seat status in a grid format with appropriate newlines. |        |
| **4. Counting Booked Seats**                              |   4    |
| - Correctly initializes a counter.                        |        |
| - Uses nested loops to iterate through the entire 2D array. |        |
| - Correctly identifies and counts booked seats (`1`).     |        |
| - Prints the final correct total of booked seats.         |        |
